              <h2>What We Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Images:</strong> Only the images you explicitly share with the app are processed using OpenAI's services.</li>

            </ul>
              <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>We only use your data to process images via OpenAI's API services using your own API key. Images and API keys are not stored by us.</p>
            
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>Your API key is securely encrypted using Android's KeyStore system and EncryptedSharedPreferences. All communications with OpenAI's servers are encrypted using HTTPS protocols.</p>
              <h2>Your Control</h2>
            <p>You have complete control over which images to share and how your API key is used. Your API key never leaves your device except to make direct API calls to OpenAI. You can view detailed information about API key security in the app settings.</p>
