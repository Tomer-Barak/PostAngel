New Features:
- Added toggle mode button in Create Post screen that allows switching between PostAngel and PostDemon modes
- Posts can now be regenerated in the opposite mode without changing app-wide settings
- Background color changes to reflect current mode (light/dark)

Improvements:
- Better UI consistency between Create Post and Share Receiver activities
- Fixed bug where initial post creation didn't respect the current app mode (PostAngel/PostDemon)
