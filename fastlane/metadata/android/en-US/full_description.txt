How PostAngel Works:

Screenshot Analysis Flow:
1. When you share a social media post screenshot, it's processed by a Vision model
2. The app analyzes the content to understand the post's topic and context
3. It then compares this context with your knowledge base of preferred topics
4. If there's a relevant match, it generates a response that naturally incorporates your topic
5. If no direct match, it provides a contextual response based on the post content

Post Creation Flow:
1. You select topics from your knowledge base
2. The app uses language models to craft a social media post
3. The post is designed to effectively communicate about your selected topics
4. You can edit the post before sharing it to your preferred platforms

PostDemon Feature:
1. Automatically detects when your device is using dark mode
2. Transforms the tone of generated posts and responses to be more sarcastic
3. Perfect for crafting posts with more personality while maintaining relevance to your topics
